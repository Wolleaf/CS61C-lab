question1:
1.How big is one cache block?
8
2.How many consecutive accesses (taking into account the step size) fit within a single block?
0
3.How much data fits in the WHOLE cache?
0
4.How far apart in memory are blocks that map to the same set (and could this create conflicts)?
32 Bytes
5.What is your cache's associativity?
1
6.Where in the cache does a particular block map to?
7.When considering why a specific access is a miss or hit: Have you accessed this piece of data before? If so, is it still in the cache or not?
Maybe. It is maybe still in the cache or not.
